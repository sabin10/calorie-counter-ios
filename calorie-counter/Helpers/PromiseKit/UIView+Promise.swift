     Animate changes to one or more views using the specified duration, delay,
     options, and completion handler.

     - Parameter duration: The total duration of the animations, measured in
     seconds. If you specify a negative value or 0, the changes are made
     without animating them.

     - Parameter delay: The amount of time (measured in seconds) to wait before
     beginning the animations. Specify a value of 0 to begin the animations
     immediately.

     - Parameter options: A mask of options indicating how you want to perform the
     animations. For a list of valid constants, see UIViewAnimationOptions.

     - Parameter animations: A block object containing the changes to commit to the
     views.

     - Returns: A promise that fulfills with a boolean NSNumber indicating
     whether or not the animations actually finished.
